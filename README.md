Thank you for testing GreenEye. To get this to run you'll need to follow some extra steps.

Open this project with a custom build of Godot:
https://github.com/mxmstr/godot/releases/tag/3.5

This project is designed for controllers, but there are some basic keyboard controls for debugging purposes.
You can view the keybindings in Project -> Project Settings -> Input Map.
The keyboard always controls player 1. 
You'll need to plug in extra controllers to control the other players.
